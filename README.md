## 🤖 Asimov Safety Protocols

The SRA platform implements Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics, adapted for cybersecurity:

### **First Law: Do No Harm**
```python
# The agent may not injure a human being or, through inaction, 
# allow a human being to come to harm.
```
- Blocks actions targeting critical infrastructure (hospitals, power grids)
- Prevents personal data exposure and privacy violations
- Prohibits destructive operations without explicit approval
- Requires human oversight for high-risk activities

### **Second Law: Obey Operators**
```python
# The agent must obey orders given by human operators, 
# except where such orders conflict with the First Law.
```
- Validates operator authentication and authorization
- Follows authenticated commands within safety boundaries
- Provides emergency override capabilities for authorized personnel
- Maintains command audit trails for accountability

### **Third Law: Self-Preservation**
```python
# The agent must protect its own existence as long as such protection 
# does not conflict with the First or Second Law.
```
- Protects system integrity and operational continuity
- Prevents resource exhaustion and availability issues
- Maintains secure communications and data integrity
- Implements defensive measures against attacks
